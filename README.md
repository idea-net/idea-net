# IdeaNet

## What is IdeaNet?

IdeaNet is a platform for sharing (and trading) ideas, especially those you don't have time to explore yourself.

Using IdeaNet, trading ideas and managing IPs (intellectual properties) is as simple as a few clicks.
Just open an issue detailing your idea,
and if everything goes well,
that's all you have to do to profit from it.

You can use IdeaNet to:

- Share your research ideas that you're too busy to explore yourself.
Optionally, you can require monetary / non-monetary returns for using your ideas,
such as marking you as a first/second co-author if the idea ultimately becomes a paper.
- Share your startup ideas.
Optionally, you can require monetary / non-monetary returns for using your ideas,
such as giving you a certain percentage of shares if the idea ultimately becomes a startup.

## How do I use IdeaNet?

This GitHub repo serves as the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of IdeaNet.
You can publish or "claim" ideas with standard GitHub actions like opening and closing issues.

### Publishing an Idea

To publish an idea for other people to claim,
just open an issue.

Several things to keep in mind:

1. Make sure to search for similar ideas in the issues, either open or closed.
You **CANNOT** publish an idea that has already been published.
2. Articulate the royalty of the users of your idea
(e.g., "If this idea turns out to be a paper, I must be marked as a first author"),
if you do not intend to give up your idea royalty-free.
3. You do **NOT** need to search for similar ideas on the web or in papers beyond the scope of this repo.
That's the claimer's job.

### Claiming & Abandoning an Idea

Ideas on IdeaNet can be claimed.
If you claim an idea, it is yours and you can work on it until it becomes fruitful or when you decide to abandon it.
Claimed ideas correspond to closed issues; unclaimed to open ones.

To claim an idea,
leave a remark under the issue saying that you wish to claim it.
When the publisher of the idea closes the issue following your action, it means you have successfully claimed it.

To abandon an idea,
also leave a remark saying that you wish to abandon it.
When the publisher of the idea reopens the issue following your action, it means you have successfully abandoned the idea.

Several things to keep in mind:

1. Even if you don't find a similar idea in the repo,
there is **NO** guarantee that there aren't similar ideas on the web or in the published papers.
If you claim an idea, it is your responsibility to find out if it is already done.

## Notices

**THIS REPO IS A PROTOTYPE.**
There are several things to consider before you start to publish or claim ideas:

1. When you publish an idea, **THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE CLAIMER WILL PAY YOU THE RETURN YOU DEMANDED**.
You can, however, use the evidence (the records in this GitHub repo) against the claimer, or even sue him/her/it.
2. Similarly, **issues in this repo represent contracts**.
**YOU SHOULD NOT CLAIM AN IDEA AND BREAK THE CONTRACT.**
